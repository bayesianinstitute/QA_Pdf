              "' Bitcoin is a new kind of digital money, which is used to compensate the peers of the system for verifying and adding new blocks to the blockchain-data-structure. It is also called cryptographic money or cryptocurrency for short and is like a bakery that pays its employees with the bread they produce, with the difference being that the bread they produce is actually a new digital currency. Bitcoin was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and follows a typical Blockchain structure with P2P shared network, Distributed ledgers, and cryptographically protected data. To use Bitcoin, someone needs to create an account in the Bitcoin blockchain by creating a digital wallet.'"
